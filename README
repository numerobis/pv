0. I'm using react. To run:
        cd hello-world
        npm start

1. data/ has data per city, 
        filename is the city name alllowernospaces.json ;
        content-transfer-encoding is gzip
        data is:
        { 'name' : '',
          'lat' : 77.77, 'long' : 80.80,
          'electric-demand' : [ 
                index by day-of-year * 24 + hour-of-day,
                value in kW
                -- data from WWF or QEC
          ],
          'temp' : [ value in C ],
          'wind' : [ same indexing, value in km/h ],
          'sun' : [ same indexing, value in W/m^2 ]
                -- data from CWEEDS for sun, and there or env can for temp/wind
        }
        todo: variance -- for now just pick up whatever data we can find
   Hourly data is 70 kB (assuming 8 bytes / value) uncompressed =>
        less than 300 kB uncompressed per community; 
        25 communities, 7.5 MB uncompressed. Getting large; figure that out
                later. (Easy solution: switch to binary, 1-2 bytes per datum;
                maybe diff-encode as well.)

2. foo.js per page? or just one. Either way, four states:
        - frontpage
        - choosecity
        - choosetech
        - displayresult

3. url includes #pagename with arguments:
                choosecity,lang=en
                choosetech,lang=en,city=iqaluit
                displayresult,lang=en,city=iqaluit,solar=2,energon2300=2

4. frontpage: map of nunavut, overlay: energy (genset + tanks + windmill + ...)
        action: choose the language - fr, en, iu

5. choosecommunity: map of nunavut, projected to have geographic center in the
        middle (no crazy stretching of ellesmere). 
        action: click on community name

6. choosetech:
        * electricity
                * generation: diesel, wind, utility solar, rooftop solar
                                (todo: other)
                * storage: utility batteries, home batteries
                * efficiency: LEDs, appliances (todo: demand-shift - data from where?)
        * heating
                * generation: district heat, oil, heat pump, resistive
                * efficiency: insulation

7. displayresult: (should this be just auto-update as we change the tech
        choices? probably!)
        $$$ by QEC, by C&I, by individuals, and sum.


Idea for later: queue up what you're buying each year, do a budget every year,
see how to get to zero CO2 as fast as possible taking into account population
growth, cost declines, varying climate, etc. Also add in the transport sector.
